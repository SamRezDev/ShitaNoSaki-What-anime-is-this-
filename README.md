An app that gives you the name of the anime ( + other details) just from the screenshot you provide

just make sure your screenshot is of good quality and covers the whole frame ! :) ( doesn't work with fanart or other outside work)

This app was made possible by using the api from trace.moe ( https://github.com/soruly/trace.moe )

if you find any issues with the app, contact me via twitter @SaRez_wd
